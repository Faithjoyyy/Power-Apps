##  Getting Started with Microsoft Power Apps

To begin your Power Apps journey:

1. **Sign in** using your organizational Microsoft 365 account.
2. Open your browser and go to make.powerapps.com — this is the **Power Apps Maker portal** where you’ll build your apps.

---

###  Navigating the Maker Portal

- Use the **left-hand menu** for key navigation options.
- At the top center, you’ll find the **Copilot text input field** — describe what you want your app to do in natural language, and Copilot will help you build it.

>  **Note:** Apps created with Copilot use **Microsoft Dataverse**, which may require additional licensing not included in most plans. If Dataverse isn’t available, start with a data source that’s included at no extra cost.

  - Microsoft training resources
  - Blogs and forums

###  Accessing OneDrive for Your App

In the next unit, you’ll create your first app using an **Excel spreadsheet stored in OneDrive**:

1. Click the **app launcher (waffle icon)** in the top-left corner of the Maker portal.
2. Select **OneDrive** to open it in a new tab.
3. Use the **+ Add new** button to upload your Excel file.

This file will serve as your app’s data source.
